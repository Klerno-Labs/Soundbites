**Content Ideas:**

**Hook (First 3 seconds):**
```
Option 1: "Stop scrolling if you've ever asked someone to repeat themselves"

Option 3: "I created a hearing quiz and the results shocked me..."
```

- Show relief/happiness after getting Soundbites

**CTA (Last 3 seconds):**
```
Text on screen: "Take the quiz now ‚¨áÔ∏è"
Voiceover: "Click below to take the 2-minute quiz"
```

**Visual Style:**
- ‚úÖ User-generated content (UGC) style (not polished ads)
- ‚úÖ Fast-paced editing
- ‚úÖ Bold text overlays
- ‚úÖ Hook in first 1 second
- ‚ùå No boring corporate feel

### TikTok Ads Pricing:

**Minimums:**

- Campaign budget: $50 minimum
- Bid: $0.10-2.00 per lead

**Realistic Costs:**
- Cost Per Lead (CPL): $2-8 (hearing health niche)

300 leads √ó 10% conversion √ó $50 = $1,500 revenue
$1,500 revenue - $1,500 ad spend = Break even

If 20% convert:
300 √ó 20% √ó $50 = $3,000 revenue
$3,000 - $1,500 = $1,500 profit (100% ROI)
```
