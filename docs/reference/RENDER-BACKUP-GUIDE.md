## 📊 Quarterly Data Organization (Recommended)

Since backups are automatic, I recommend using the **Export buttons** in your admin panel for organized quarterly reports:

### End of Each Quarter:
1. **Export CSV**: Download all raw data
   - Click "📥 Export CSV" in admin panel
   - Save as: `Soundbites-Q4-2024-Data.csv`

2. **Export PDF**: Download professional report
   - Click "📄 Export PDF" in admin panel
   - Save as: `Soundbites-Q4-2024-Report.pdf`

3. **Store in Cloud**:
   - Upload both to Google Drive/OneDrive
   - Folder structure: `Soundbites/2024/Q4/`

### Calendar Reminders:
- **March 31**: Export Q1 data
- **June 30**: Export Q2 data
- **September 30**: Export Q3 data
- **December 31**: Export Q4 data

## 🚀 Next Steps

## 💡 Pro Tip: Test Your Backup

It's good practice to test restoring once:

1. Export current database manually (Create Manual Backup)
2. Download the backup file
3. Verify you can open/read it
4. Store it safely

This ensures your backup process works when you actually need it!
