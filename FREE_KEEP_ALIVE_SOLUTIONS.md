## ❌ What NOT to Use (Costs Money):

- ❌ Render Cron Jobs ($0.00016/min = ~$7/month)
- ❌ AWS Lambda (free tier limited, then costs)
- ❌ Paid uptime services

---

## 🏆 My Recommendation:

**Use UptimeRobot** - It's the industry standard and:
- Used by millions of developers
- 100% free forever
- More reliable than DIY solutions
- Gives you uptime monitoring too
- No coding needed

2. Or use one of the other free services above
